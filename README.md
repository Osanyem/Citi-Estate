# Citi-Estate
A website for listing, renting and buying real estate.

Created as a personal project after my intership as a web developer.

I used HTML, Javascript, PHP, JSON and SQL to create a responsive and dynamic website.

Here, you can find the complete code for the website including the bootstrap and javascript files, additionally I have uploaded the full SQL queries for creating the required database. Feel free to contact me at oosadebe@ryerson.ca if you have any questions about this projectðŸ˜ƒ.
